# eg repo

## This is an example repo to practise git push and git pull 

### Included in this is:
- creating a remote and local machine repo
- connecting the remote and local repos
- initial pull and then push to establish connection and set this GitHub repo as default remote repo to push and pull from
- the easier business of pushing and pulling once this connection is established

### Still to come:
- creating a branch
- shortcuts for README.md formatting
- .gitignore
